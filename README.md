## About `cptpy`

`cptpy` is a Python package for processing cone penetration test (CPT) data. The
package is still in the __alpha stage__ meaning you as a user _should_ expect
bugs and API changes, of course feedback is greatly appreciated. With that said
the packages includes two primary class definitions `CPT` and `CPTu` for
standard CPT and CPT plus pore water pressure readings, respectively.
