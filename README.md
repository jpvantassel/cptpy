## About `cptpy`

`cptpy` is a Python package for processing cone penetration test (CPT) data. The
package is still in the __alpha stage__ meaning you as a user should expect
bugs, limited functionality, and API changes. Bug reports, feature request, and
general feedback is greatly appreciated. The packages currently includes
two primary class definitions `CPT` and `CPTu` for standard CPT and CPT plus
pore water pressure readings, respectively.
