cptpy Documentation
====================

`cptpy` is a Python package for processing cone penetration test (CPT) data. The
package is still in the __alpha stage__ meaning you as a user _should_ expect
bugs and API changes, of course feedback is greatly appreciated. With that said
the packages includes two primary class definitions `CPT` and `CPTu` for
standard CPT and CPT with pore water pressure readings, respectively.

This package and the classes therein are actively being developed, so if you
do not see a feature you would like it may very well be under development and
released in the near future. To be notified of future releases, you can either
``watch`` the repository on
`Github <https://github.com/jpvantassel/cptpy>`_ or
``Subscribe to releases`` on the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/cptpy/>`_.
